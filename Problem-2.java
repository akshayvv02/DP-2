/**
 * Approach:
 * - Goal: Find the number of ways to make up a target amount using unlimited coins.
 * - Initialize a dp array where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations to make amount `i`.
 * - Set `dp[0] = 1` as base case (1 way to make amount 0).
 * - For each coin:
 *   - Update `dp[a]` for all `a` from coin to amount by adding `dp[a - coin]`.
 *   - This ensures we count all combinations that include the current coin.
 * - After processing all coins, `dp[amount]` contains the total number of combinations.
